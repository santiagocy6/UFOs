# UFOs

## Overview 
I built a website using Javascript that filter UFO's data for Dana. This amazing prject let us filter the data based on the date, city, state, country and shape. I also applied different filters. 

## Results

To perform a search is quite easy. On the left side on the website is a section called "Filter Search"
Each search criteria has a placeholder, showing the kind of data you can search for.

If, for example, you only wanted to search for UFO sightings in New York State, you'd type 'ny' where is says 'Enter State' and press Enter

As you can see, this filtered the results to only show sightings from New York State.

You can search with multiple filters! For example, if I only wanted to find sightings in the US where the shape is a triangle, I would type 'us' into 'Enter Country' and 'triangle' into 'Enter Shape'.


I also attached some screenshots where you can see the results that I describe on the analysis.
